#This is the pages.py file. Here we structure how our pages and pagesequence function.
#Each page has its own class where you always specify form_model = Player as we have players for each page
#and we have the form_fields in a list which indicate the variables we have on that page. There will be
#more functionality added here but this is a good start.
